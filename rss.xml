            <title><![CDATA[Those Tired Eyes]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Those eyes. Those tired eyes.One look and I'm drawn into those deep pools and I wonderâ€˜bout the feelings borne within.When you stare out so blanklylost in thoughts you call your ownI see the words you can not tell me.Know this, you weren't alone.Yet I can't say those words directlyI just hope to catch your eyeto tell you how I understandthrough connections you deny.Occasionally I will get the lookthat tells me what I know.It makes me ache we can not talkand struggle letting go.Yet it's only half the storyand I can only second guessas to the how, or why...Were you feeling second best?I see the hurt behind those eyes,the likely reasons for it too.My heart bleeds upon the thoughtthat I can't comfort you.So stare into the sky, avoidthe one who bears your blame.Or maybe sometimes catch my eye,tear that old wound again.</p>]]></description>
