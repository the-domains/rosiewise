# Trust

I slump down on the sofa  
secretly hoping I'll find myself  
sitting next to someone I know.  
I glance right to see  
you look up from your phone  
and throw your head back  
in recognition and disbelief.  
I throw mine back in amusement.

Bingo!

No questions about why I'm there.  
That's a given.  
You get to the point.  
"So what you doing now?"  
expecting to hear some made up excuse  
"Oh waiting... for a friend..."  
who walks over right on queue.  
Oblivious to you  
and our conversation.

She doesn't recognise you  
and you watch bemused as we greet.  
Like you're invisible.  
If only she knew!  
A few words and she goes again  
just quick hello to let me know she's here.

"She's a wild one that one."  
"Yes, can be a bit much at times."  
"She puts the boys off!"  
I quickly change the subject.  
"I knew you were here  
I saw your brother yesterday."  
"I knew you was here cos he told me,  
that and we checked to see who was staying.  
Can't be here with a bunch of crazies!  
But not you.  
We trust you Rosie.  
You know that anyways!"

Yes. I knew.  
Actions speak louder than words  
and it was the lack of reactions  
that made me suspect it.  
No need to deflect or protect  
in this private public space.  
I was just people watching again.
