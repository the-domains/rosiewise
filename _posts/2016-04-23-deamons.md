I'm sitting on the edge again  
thinking of going in.  
Simply toying with the idea,  
before trying.  
It's not going to be easy  
but I can not let them win.  
Have to be well grounded  
before flying.

For I'm going on a journey  
and I have to go alone.  
But please, there is no need for you  
to worry.  
I aim to go where I can rest  
and while it's close to home,  
I may fail, should I dare try  
to hurry.

My daemons never really  
want to let me rest in peace.  
They always seem to try to  
weigh me down.  
I want to track 'em down, round 'em up  
and tame them for my leash  
or they may run amok, 'n' flip my  
life around.

Yet I can't tell you face to face  
about the things I'll likely find.  
They may get the upper hand and drive  
me crazy.  
And you may think I'm psycho  
to go digging in my mind.  
But it's time I really got to know  
who made me.
